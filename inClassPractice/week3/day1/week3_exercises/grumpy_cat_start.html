	<h1>Grumpy Cat </h1>

	<p><strong>Tardar Sauce</strong> (April 4, 2012 â€“ May 14, 2019), nicknamed <strong>Grumpy Cat</strong>, was an American Internet celebrity cat. She was known for her permanently "grumpy" facial appearance, which was caused by an underbite and feline dwarfism. She came to prominence when a photograph of her was posted on September 22, 2012, on social news website Reddit by Bryan Bundesen, the brother of her owner Tabatha Bundesen. "Lolcats" and parodies created from the photograph by Reddit users became popular. She was the subject of a popular Internet meme in which humorously negative, cynical images were made from photographs of her.</p>
